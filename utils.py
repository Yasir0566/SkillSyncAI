Small, focused helper functions used by cli.py. Keeping these separate from
the main loop (cli.py) and the network code (groq_client.py) makes each file
easy to read on its own -- this one has zero network calls, so it's also
trivial to test.

    "The initiative is designed to bridge the gap between traditional education and the evolving tech job market by training students and fresh graduates in high-demand, future-focused technical skills. "
    "Key Focus Areas & Features "
    "Core Technical Training: The platform offers intensive workshops, bootcamps, and courses focusing heavily on AI workflows, large language models (LLMs), automation engineering, and full-stack development. "
    "Practical Learning: Rather than focusing solely on theory, it teaches advanced topics like Context Engineering and \"red teaming\" (testing AI security perimeters against jailbreaks) through hands-on, multi-project labs. "
    "Real-World Experience: Students actively build production-ready projects—such as AI recruiting tools, automated customer support bots, and workflow systems—using tools like n8n, Make.com, and LangGraph. "
    "The skillIT Connection: It operates alongside a sister placement initiative called skillIT. Once students complete their training in the community, vetted engineers are connected with companies looking to hire talent to build customized business automation and AI infrastructure."
