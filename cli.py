"""
cli.py
------
The main entry point for the LLM-Powered CLI Assistant.

Run it from the terminal with:
    python cli.py                  (defaults to Q&A mode)
    python cli.py --mode summarize (summarizer mode instead)

What this program does, step by step:
    1. Load your Groq API key from a .env file (never hardcoded in source).
    2. Ask which "mode" you want: a Q&A assistant or a text summarizer.
    3. Loop: read what you type, send it (plus the conversation history so
       far) to the model, print the reply.
    4. Type 'quit' (or Ctrl+C) to exit -- the full conversation is then
       automatically saved to a JSON file inside logs/.

Every risky step (missing API key, a failed network call) is handled
gracefully -- this program is designed to never crash with a raw traceback
in the user's face.

#what is argparse doing: argparse is a standard library module in Python that provides a way
#    to handle command-line arguments passed to a script. It allows you to define what arguments
#    your program requires, parse those arguments from the command line, and automatically 
# generate help and usage messages. In this code snippet, argparse is used to read
#  command-line arguments such as the mode of operation (Q&A or summarizer) and the 
# maximum number of tokens for the model's response.
